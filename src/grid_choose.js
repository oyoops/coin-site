              Tuna once led a tough life; neglected, unwanted, and ugly. Wherever Tuna treks, he broke mirrors and caused accidents as onlookers stared at him in disgust. "Abomination! Abomination!" they shouted, in disbelief that a higher power would have created something so hideous.
            </p>

            <p className="banner__text text text--small text--regular text--muted why-text">
              Against all odds, Tuna was adopted by a loving family, given an Instagram account, and blew up; Tuna quickly gained over <strong>1.9M followers</strong> by posting daily funny faces, outfits, and poses.
              Even the ugliest dogs deserve loving homes to rise and meet their full potentials. For every Tuna that is adopted and loved, there are so many who go unadopted and unloved for life, and that's it.
              Is today the day you decide to adopt your own <b>Tuna</b> to love and admire? To be forever-companions? Won't you adopt Tuna for what's underneath?
              Might a lovable, famous Chiweenie hiding behind such a gruff, unkempt exterior? Tuna just wants to be your best friend. If not you, then who will?
